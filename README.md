# Canonical Coordinate System for Geometry Learn
## Introduction
- It is not handy to apply CNN on graph convolution because no grid system
- This project provide such grid system on the parametrization

## Steps
### Step 1: Cut the surface and map to Poincare disk

### Step 2: Get the canonical coordinate for the convolution on the Poincare disk

### Step 3: Convolution along the canonical coordinates


## Applications

### Classification

### Transfer Learning

### Surface Generation







## Graph Embedding
